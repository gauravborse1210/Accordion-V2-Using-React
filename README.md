#Accordion Version 2 Using React
When we click on any accordion it will show full description and by clicking again on same accordion it will hide details.
In Version 1 of accordion we can able to open all accordions at same time but in this Version we can open only single accordion at once, if the accordion is already opened and we clicked on another accordion then previously opened accordion will closed and currently clicked accordion will opened.
